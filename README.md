# Neonatal-Resuscitation

This is a repository for the NeoTapp project within the Global Child Health and SDGs Team

Heart rate assessment is crucial in neonatal resuscitation, but pulse oximetry and electrocardiography are rarely accessible in low- to middle-income settings. This project aims to  evaluated a free-of-charge smartphone application, NeoTap Life Support (NeoTapLS), recording heart rate with a screen-tapping method bypassing mental arithmetic calculations. Reserach studies were conducted at SachsÂ´Children and Youth Hospital, Sweden and in Kampala, Uganda through collaboration with Kawempe National Referral Hospital, Uganda and the University of Bergen, Norway.
